# AsanaAI-Corrector
AsanaAI-Corrector is an AI-powered yoga posture analysis system that leverages MediaPipe BlazePose for landmark detection and Random Forest for pose classification. Designed for cost-effective real-time feedback, it helps users self-correct their yoga poses by classifying them as "correct" or "incorrect" and displaying intuitive on-screen guidance. This project includes a complete pipelineâ€”from video frame extraction and keypoint processing to machine learning-based classification and correction mechanism.
